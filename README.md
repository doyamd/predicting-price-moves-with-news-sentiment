# Predicting Price Moves with News Sentiment

This project explores the relationship between financial news sentiment and stock price movements. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and time series analysis, we aim to uncover whether specific types of news events can influence short-term price movements.

## Project Goals

- Analyze headlines and news data to extract sentiment and categorize events.
- Correlate news sentiment with corresponding stock price movements.
- Identify market reactions to specific event types (e.g., IPOs, Mergers, Earnings Reports).
- Visualize patterns in publishing times and publisher contributions.

## Datasets

- `raw_analyst_ratings.csv`: Contains financial news headlines with publication dates, URLs, and publishers.
- `AAPL_historical_data.csv`, `GOOGL_historical_data.csv`, etc.: Stock price history for multiple companies.

## Features
